Opening Files and File Modes\n","\n","**The `open()` function**:\n","The built in `open()` function is used to open a file and returns a file object that can be used for reading or writing the file. The general syntax is:\n","\n","```python\n","file = open('filename', 'mode', 'encoding')\n","```\n","encoding is optional and specifies how unicode is mapped into bytes. (Not our focus right now). encoding='utf-8' by default.\n","\n","\n","**File Modes**:\n","- **`'r'`**: Read (default mode). Opens the file for reading. If the file doesn’t exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.\n","- **`'w'`**: Write. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it **overwrites** it; if the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new file.\n","- **`'a'`**: Append. Opens the file for writing, **adding** content at the end of the file, without deleting existing content.\n","- **`'x'`**: Exclusive creation. Creates a new file, but if the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.\n","- **`'rb'`**: Read binary. Opens the file for reading in binary format (useful for non-text files like images or audio).\n","- **`'wb'`**: Write binary. Opens the file for writing in binary format.\n","- **`'r+'`**: Read and write. Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file must exist; otherwise, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.\n","- **`'w+'`**: Write and read. Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file is **overwritten** if it exists; otherwise, a new file is created.\n","- **`'a+'`**: Append and read. Opens the file for both reading and appending. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.\n","\n","#### **Combining Modes**:\n","- **`'r+b'`**: Read and write in binary mode.\n","- **`'w+t'`**: Write and read in text mode (implicitly used for text files).\n","\n","**Example**:"],"id":"fd4f5b1502952ede"},{"metadata":{"id":"20c3f9b987a62eec","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739900403388,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":94,"user":{"displayName":"Samriddhi Matharu","userId":"15444417249591811102"}},"outputId":"6cdb4c60-9802-4e30-bbc4-b2c18d69c96e"},"cell_type":"code","source":["%%writefile example.txt\n","    This is the content of my text file.\n","    This is the second line\n","    And this is the third and final line"],"id":"20c3f9b987a62eec","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Overwriting example.txt\n"]}],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"e6746a2ac10aba60","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":245},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1740610845395,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":274,"user":{"displayName":"Samriddhi Matharu","userId":"15444417249591811102"}},"outputId":"a84b54a0-385d-4efd-eafd-9c499b944c28"},"cell_type":"code","source":["file=open('example.txt', 'r+') #is one way of opening file. \"file\" object here is an iterator, and maintains a pointer that is the offset from the start of thefile.\n","\n","print(type(file)) #buffered text stream over binary stream, does buffering and encoding internally.\n","print(file.tell()) #prints the offset\n","print(file.__next__()) #reads one line\n","print(file.read())\n","file.close()\n","print(\"________________\")\n","\n","# Opening a file for reading and writing (must already exist)\n","with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:\n","    content = file.read()  # Reads the content\n","    print(content)\n","    print(\"________________\")\n","    file.seek(0)  # Moves the cursor back to the beginning of the file\n","    print(file.write(\"New content\")) # Writes new content, replacing the old, the print prints out the current  offset of the\n","    print(\"________________\")\n"],"id":"e6746a2ac10aba60","outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","evalue":"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'example.txt'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-1-ee7c4b098b20>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mopen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'example.txt'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m'r+'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#is one way of opening file. \"file\" object here is an iterator, and maintains a pointer that is the offset from the start of thefile.\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtype\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#buffered text stream over binary stream, does buffering and encoding internally.\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtell\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#prints the offset\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0m__next__\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#reads one line\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'example.txt'"]}],"execution_count":1},{"metadata":{"id":"ecd945964655e93f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","**Discussion**:\n","- **`r+` vs `w+`**:\n","  - **`r+`** allows you to read and write, but the file must exist.\n","  - **`w+`** will **overwrite** the file, whether or not it exists.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **2.
