These tasks include problem-solving, learning, decision-making, speech recognition, and visual perception. AI systems are designed to simulate human cognitive functions and can learn from experience, improving their performance over time. One of the main goals of AI is to create intelligent agents that can perform tasks autonomously without constant human intervention. AI technologies have been successfully implemented in various fields, such as robotics, healthcare, finance, and transportation. For example, AI-powered medical diagnostic systems can analyze medical images to detect diseases like cancer, while self-driving cars are capable of navigating streets and traffic without human input.\"\n","\n","\n","# your code goes here\n","sentences=[sentence.strip() for sentence in input_text.split('.') if sentence.strip()] #only keep non-empty strings\n","\n","cat_words=[]\n","all_unique_words=set()\n","\n","for sentence_num, sentence in enumerate(sentences,1):\n","  cleaned_sentence=''.join(char for char in sentence if char.isalnum() or char.isspace()).lower()\n","  words=cleaned_sentence.split()\n","\n","  short_words=[word for word in words if len(word)<=3]\n","  medium_words=[word for word in words if 4<=len(word)<=6]\n","  long_words=[word for word in words if len(word)>6]\n","\n","\n","  cat_words.append((\"Short\", short_words))\n","  cat_words.append((\"Medium\", medium_words))\n","  cat_words.append((\"Long\", long_words))\n","\n","\n","  sentence_unique_words=set(words)\n","  print((sentence_num, sentence_unique_words))\n","\n","  all_unique_words.update(words)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","short_count=len([word for word in all_unique_words if len(word) <= 3])\n","medium_count=len([word for word in all_unique_words if 4 <= len(word) <= 6])\n","long_count=len([word for word in all_unique_words if len(word) > 6])\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","print(f\"The Total number of unique words in the entire text: {len(all_unique_words)}\")\n","print(f\"Number of unique short words: {short_count}\")\n","print(f\"Number of unique medium words: {medium_count}\")\n","print(f\"Number of unique long words: {long_count}\")\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fQpdMInhLLtk","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740437748404,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Samriddhi Matharu","userId":"15444417249591811102"}},"outputId":"bb2a4737-78d0-470f-ca89-5c3e54d05ed6"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(1, {'computer', 'ai', 'a', 'intelligence', 'machines', 'creating', 'require', 'that', 'normally', 'branch', 'performing', 'tasks', 'is', 'on', 'artificial', 'human', 'would', 'science', 'of', 'capable', 'focuses'})\n","(2, {'problemsolving', 'include', 'recognition', 'perception', 'tasks', 'speech', 'learning', 'and', 'decisionmaking', 'these', 'visual'})\n","(3, {'functions', 'cognitive', 'systems', 'their', 'are', 'ai', 'time', 'designed', 'improving', 'experience', 'performance', 'and', 'can', 'over', 'from', 'learn', 'simulate', 'human', 'to'})\n","(4, {'one', 'perform', 'intervention', 'intelligent', 'main', 'ai', 'constant', 'without', 'can', 'create', 'that', 'goals', 'tasks', 'is', 'the', 'autonomously', 'human', 'agents', 'of', 'to'})\n","(5, {'implemented', 'been', 'as', 'transportation', 'have', 'finance', 'technologies', 'various', 'in', 'and', 'successfully', 'healthcare', 'robotics', 'fields', 'such', 'ai'})\n","(6, {'example', 'systems', 'like', 'images', 'are', 'analyze', 'detect', 'input', 'aipowered', 'traffic', 'without', 'medical', 'diagnostic', 'for', 'and', 'selfdriving', 'can', 'navigating', 'cars', 'diseases', 'while', 'human', 'streets', 'of', 'to', 'cancer', 'capable'})\n","14\n","The Total number of unique words in the entire text: 91\n","Number of unique short words: 14\n","Number of unique medium words: 28\n","Number of unique long words: 49\n"]}]}]}
